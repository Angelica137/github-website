      <h2>
        Hi, I am Angelica, A UX designer and budding developer working and
        living in London.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have worked as a UX designer for the past seven years and enjoy
        working to solve complex problems that help users in a tangible way.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my tech career progressed, I became increasingly interested in the
        tech challenges of implementation. As I dedicate more time to learning
        about software and collaborate with developers more and more in my day
        to day job, I am now in a position where transitioning to the dev side
        is a natural progression for me. I believe Founders & Coders can help me
        achieve this dream.
      </p>
